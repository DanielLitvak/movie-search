## What I learned from this project

- Create React App has Sass ready to go with no additinal setup.
- If CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' missing then you need a CORS proxy.
- Web scraping with Xpath using `document.evaluate()`.
- How to make CSS grid responsive with `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));`.
